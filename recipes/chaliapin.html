            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                The dish is exclusively made by Sōma combined with the Japanese original dish, the Chaliapin Steak, and
                the
                donburi concept for his first Shokugeki. Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that can be
                found in
                a supermarket, the meal focused on both innovation and balance of the ingredients to fulfill the donburi
                mantra,
                "Dons are completed in one bowl."
            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 beef sirloin steaks</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 onions</li>
                <li>2 bowls of rice</li>
                <li>1 tbsp pickled-plu paste</li>
                <li>Potato starch</li>
                <li>4 tbsp red wine</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>Chopped green onions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Mince the onions. Trim the fat off the steak and using a meat tenderizer, tenderize the steaks
                    well. Afterwards, cover the steaks with the minced onion all over the surface and let the onions sit
                    on the steaks for 30 minutes. Then remove the onions (do NOT throw them away) and season the steaks
                    with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a skillet and saute the minced onions. Season with salt and pepper, and
                    then move them to a plate.
                </li>
                <li>Melt the remaining butter in a frying pan and cook the steaks until they are brown on both sides and
                    transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>Now make the sauce by adding red wine to the same skillet and mix it with the meat juices from the
                    previous step. Once it has reduced, add the minced onions and saute them once more. Add soy sauce
                    and use potato starch as needed to thicken the sauce.</li>
                <li>Mix the pickled-plum paste with the cooked rice and divide them into two bowls. Place the steaks
                    into each bowl and pour the sauce over each steak. Garnish with chopped green onions, and you’re
                    done!</li>
            </ol>

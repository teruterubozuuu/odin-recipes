    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A frozen egg that is deep-fried in tempura batter, producing a soft-boiled tempura egg over rice. Though the dish
        uses common, low-grade eggs, the dishes' power comes from this fact as no other egg grade can produce the flavor
        that dish can create. Despite its low grade ingredients, it was sufficient enough to please Erina's God Tongue.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bowls of cooked rice</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>5 tbsp wheat or rice flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp potato starch</li>
        <li>6 tbsp cold water</li>
        <li>100ml dashi broth</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp each mirin and sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>Frying oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Freeze the eggs in the freezer, and once completely frozen, peel them. 
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the frying oil and heat it until it reaches 320°F/160°C.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the [A] ingredients into a bowl and whisk everything together. Slowly add the cold water while whisking until the mixture is blended into a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Dust the eggs with flour, dip them into the batter you just made, and then deep-fry them for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Optionally, dip the face of shiso leaves in the batter as well and deep-fry them until they are crispy.</li>
        <li>Pour the [B] ingredients into a small saucepan. Mix them together and let them simmer for about 3 minutes to make the sauce.</li>
        <li>Fill 2 bowls with the cooked rice and pour a dash of the sauce over the top. Arrange the eggs and shiso on top of the rice, pour more sauce over them, and you’re done!</li>
